# Multi Tool
 This is basically just to see how the community will take care of this puppy.
 Everything is built from scratch in Python 3.7/3.8 - Coded to use on Windows, but can be ported to Linux based systems pretty easily.

## How do I use it?
 Install Python 3.8.x => https://www.python.org/downloads/
 Open commmand prompt in the MULTI-master folder
 Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 Run `python multi.py`
